                <p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 15px;">We formed a group and named our group as a  JAG fam.

We decided on our concept as an autonomous food delivery service. These days, streets are always crowded and people are always very busy so, effective time management is a key in this busy annd fast-paced lifestyle. A Food delivery service is just beginnig to speard out in Australia but, there is some problem areas such as delaying of delivery or the quality of delivered food. I think it is a great idea to use autonomous vehicle for food delivery service. We haven't decided on the autonomous vehicle yet but I guess drone is the most suitable autonomous technology for the food delivery service. Drones can fly and there is no traffic congestions in the sky which means customers can get their food very fast.
I read a desgin bried and tried to plan out for the upcoming asssessment.

                <p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 15px;">This week, Our group decided on our targetting users.  Basically, our autonomous drone or robot for food delivery service is supposed to be quick for the busy university students and working people and help them to get their food as soon as possible and help them to use time efficiently. I conducted an online survey based on the questions I created with my group members. I created a survey through the website called SurveyMonkey. I had 12 questions in total including all demographic questions and short answers. I also started to do the background research on the autonomous vehicle delivery service.We learned the many numbers of user research methods durind the tutorial and I chose three different research methods for the first assessment.  </p>

I had a interview session with five university students this week and closed the online survey. 

i tried to analyse key findings from both the interview and online survey. After summarising key findings and insights from the user research, I made an affinity diagram first based on the key findings that i found with the research. I focused on the way to improve the current food delivery service since food delivery service in Australia is now starting to spread out. 

After analysing both interview and survey data, I created three personas.

During this week’s tutorial,  We learned about the importance of creating  scenario of the potential users. I enjoyed the tutorial and was thinking about including some problem scenarios for the first assessment.

                <p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 15px;">I created three different problem scenarios and I mainly worked on the storyboard throughout the studio. i drew two storyboards on two  different current problem areas .

I showed three storyboards to the friends and developed it based on their feedback. i changed the drawing to make it even more clear since there was some students said that the storyboard is confusing and hard to understand what the problem area is.

I ordered a food by using foodora to see how the delivery works at the moment and created a narrative storyboard with a friend.

I did a last-minute observation after studio on the street. I saw lots of delivery couriers stuck on the street because of the crowdedness on the street and understood the reason of delay, I believe that drone delivery service can be solved  the problem. 



Reflection on the first assessment: 

I focused on the persona and storyboard way too much rather that focus on the insights from the user research,

i couldn't really get rich insights from the user research since I had fairly small sample size and the answers from the respondents were very similar.

                  During studio, me and my group members were struggling with creating two initial concepts I  thought that it’s really important to understand and clearly identify our future users in order to have stronger concepts.
                  
                  We started to draw a storyboard individually. Later, We compared each other's storyboard together. My storyboard was based on a busy university student who needs to get foods as quick as possible. I added one feacture that autonmous delivery robots can not be unlocked if users don't have the security code. The security code will be sent to their app after users order foods on the app.  I added this feature to reduce the loss on food while delivering. </p>

Me and my group developed our concept even more stronger by targeting university students who live in dorm since they tend to order a lot we believed that fast delivery service can help them a lot with saving time. 
and i created a storyboard but it was wrong in terms of not including the whole process of the delivery.</p>

                <p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 15px;">
Since we changed the targeting users, we again had to conduct a survey  for our new concept  who live in dorm since we changed the targeting users.

While conducting a survey, we heard that our concepts are  still not strong enough or too generic so we had to think about other concept again. I was thinking about the canteen food delivery service and group members liked the idea as well.

End of the studio, we had to change our concept to autonomous vehicle which can help  parking rangers from food delivery service.


We had to start to do the background research on parking rangers and what they do or how they do their work,
We also need to find the current issues with the current technology and problem areas.

After finishing some of background research, we worked on developing two initial concepts of an app again.</p>

We learned how to use a framer to make a better prototype and framer x was not a easy tool for me to use. 

I  created a storyboard of future experience of parking rangers with the autonomous drone technology.</p>

21/9- We were desperate to have a interview with parking rangers to get some information since we haven’t got any response from any council. We looked for parking rangers on the street and approached them. Finally got a chance to have  a street interview with two parking rangers. They are from the city of sydney.They mentioned and empathized about verbal and physical abuse that parking rangers have to go through. They didn’t really enjoy the idea about drones throughout. Thanks to Erwin and Vicky to take a  moment for us and let us  interview them. 

We finally managed to have two different concepts for the parking rangers. We got responses from few different council and we called Martin who is from burwood council and asked the prepared questions to see his view on the patrolling dornes. He sounds very skeptical about the autonomous drone idea but he is very knowledgeable and gave us lots of informations about current issues.

					I observed what kinds of technology they are currently using for paying parking fee in Melbourne. 
					
					
					
					
					I did some sketches based on the concept of parking enforcement drone app.I made a paper prototype before meeting David who is from strathfield council and I made a click-through app with the low-fidelity wireframes by using POP for him to easily test it out.</p>

I started to structure report for assessment two as hamish mentioned in the lecture. I made the prototype based on the paper prototype to show david and developed it based on the feedback for the next iteration.</p>

                <p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 15px;">We had meeting with David at strathfield. He was really friendly and willing to help us. He worried about the regulations on the drone. He firstly showed us an app called Pin force and let us experience the current interface of the app.I explanied about the concept one to him and gave him a quick overview of the app by showing the paper prototype and I asked him to use the click-through app and gave him some tasks such as issuing infringement notice or finding parking violators. He said the interface is very easy to navigate. He just gave feedbacks on the structure of the infringement notice. 

					
					

I started working on the low fidelity wireframe of the first concept which is parking enforcement drone app since he liked first concept the most.

We had the other meeting with Martin at Burwood council on Monday. I read his journal that he gave us last time before meeting with him. He is very knowledgeable and really keen to see the autonomous drone technology in real life. He was really enjoying the concept itself rather than the interface. He worried that there is lots of hurdles to go through to use the drone technology in real life. 

We had user testing with five parking rangers on our final iteration. User testing went smoothly, and the app seemed to have degree of completion. They all had very positive response towards the interface. We appreciated for positive responses.
It was quite challenging for me to re-design for each iterations one, two, and three. However, I felt like I am getting more familiar with all those design tools through this assessment. In other words, I have gained confidence in designing different levels of app prototypes.

I designed the whole interface again based on the feedback we previously got. I used sketch to design the whole app. It was a great challenge. After designing the whole interface, i did a colour testing with friends to see which background works best for the parking rangers. I really like the black and white colour palette but others told me to use distinct colours to stand out the map or the usage of an app. 

we started to design our final app by using figma. i believe that as a designer it is super important to use various types of tool. It was great to play around and explore with new technology like figma since i was only familiar with the sketch, indesign and invision.Even though the general use of the tool was similar, it was quite different to sketch so it took for a while to get used to the whole system.



we also tried to add more features in the app such as admin view and statistics.</p>

                <p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 15px;">We were supposed to meet up with David again on Wednesday to get some footages to make a walkthrough video and  his thoughts on the final prototypes but he couldn’t come. It was very frustrating since we all thought we could meet him and get his opinion. Therefore, we contacted Mahfuzul if he is free or around strathfield tomorrow and he let us meet him so we decided to meet up with Mahfuzul on thursday which was the due date but we didn’t have any choice.

I was in charge of editing a walkthrough video so, I made a storyline for the walkthrough video and decided to use green screen drone footage to put flying  drone in our video.I shouldn’t have put so much time on the editing but I was trying too hard to make a good video which i shouldn’t have done. 

Mahfuzul gave us general feedback on our app. He liked the infringement notice structure and menu better than before and he liked the colour as well.

We had issues with the colour scheme for our final app and finally decided to go with the bright red colour because we believed that it works the best throughout day and night time. We changed the whole colour of the app in the last minute and it was very hard for me to record the new interface and edit the video again. </p>

 <p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 15px;">I renamed our app as a “dop” which stands for drone on patrol. I tried to think of a better name but I couldn’t and still like the name “DOP” better than MyDrones so we decided to go with the name “DOP”.
